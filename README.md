# LoanReady
LoanReady is an AI-powered platform designed to level the playing field. It acts as a dedicated financial analyst for any SMB, demystifying the loan application process. A user simply uploads their standard financial statements (e.g., P&amp;L, Balance Sheet), and our application performs an instantaneous, in-depth analysis.

LoanReady by KapitalCo-Pilot
Your AI co-pilot to secure the funding your business needs.

LoanReady is a web platform that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze the financial health of a small or medium-sized business (SMB) and automatically generate a bank-ready solvency report.

üöÄ Why LoanReady?
SMBs are the engine of the economy, yet accessing capital is often their biggest hurdle. The loan application process is complex, requires deep financial analysis, and involves preparing reports that many business owners lack the time or resources to create.

LoanReady solves this problem by acting as a personal financial analyst, democratizing access to professional-quality reports and empowering entrepreneurs to approach financial institutions with confidence and solid data.

AI-Powered Financial Analysis: Upload your financial statements (P&L and Balance Sheet in .csv format) and let our AI do the heavy lifting.

Key Ratio Calculation: The platform automatically calculates the most important financial metrics that banks evaluate (liquidity, profitability, debt, etc.).

Intelligent Executive Summary: Receive a summary in plain, simple language that explains your financial strengths and areas for improvement.

Solvency Report: Generate a clean, professional, one-page report designed to make a great first impression with any lender.
